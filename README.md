##### Tutorial: Scheduling Cron Jobs

In this tutorial, we'll help a new startup, TaskWire, to create a proof-of-concept feature for sending task lists to uses once a day. To do it, we'll create a cron job that fires once every 24 hours, calling a module that compiles a user's task list and sends it to their email address.
